# Advent of Code 2025

Written in Julia

## Usage

1. Enter a Julia REPL
2. `] activate .`
3. `using AOC2025`
4. Then run a function for whatever day you want, e.g., `day01()` will run parts 1 and 2 for day 1.

## Development Notes

- Increment the range at the top of `src/AOC2025.jl` every time you add a new day.
